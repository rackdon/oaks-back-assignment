## Requirements
- Every phase can have an unlimited amount of tasks
- If the startup accomplishes all tasks in the phase, itâ€™s marked as done and unlocks the next phase.
- Tasks cannot be marked as completed unless all tasks in the previous phase were completed.

## How to run
For the first time, npm install is needed
```$xslt
$ npm install
```

### Run with fake database (memory storage) (default)
Run the server
```$xslt
$ npm run start
```

### Run with real database
As running database is needed it can be launched through docker compose and automatically will create the tables
and the owner role
```$xslt
$ docker-compose up
```

For the first time, execute migrations is needed
```$xslt
$ DATABASE_URL=postgres://owner:owner@localhost:5432/oaks npm run migrate up
```

Run the server 
```$xslt
$ LOG_LEVEL=info DB_MEMORY=false DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5432 DB_NAME=oaks DB_USERNAME=owner DB_PASSWORD=owner npm run start
```

## Database Structure
Phases
- id (uuid)
- name (string unique)
- done (boolean default false)
- created_on (date without timezone default now())
- updated_on (date without timezone default now())

Tasks
- id (uuid)
- phase_id (uuid (fk phases.id))
- name (string)
- done (boolean default false)
- created_on (date without timezone default now())
- updated_on (date without timezone default now())


## Commands

- npm run build -> Create the build
- npm run start -> Create the build and starts the server (necessary specify env vars)
- npm run local -> Launch the server locally including nodemon watcher (takes dev vars)
- npm run local:memory -> Launch the server locally with memory db including nodemon watcher (takes dev.memory vars)
- npm run test -> Run the unit tests
- npm run integration-test -> Run the integration tests (migrations in oaks_test db needed)
- npm run all-test -> Run all tests (migrations in oaks_test db needed)
- npm run test:coverage -> Run all tests and calculate coverage (migrations in oaks_test db needed)


## Migrations
[more info](https://salsita.github.io/node-pg-migrate/#/)

### Create
```$xslt
$ npm run migrate create your migration name
```

### Migrate
```$xslt
$ DATABASE_URL=postgres://owner:owner@localhost:5432/oaks npm run migrate up
```

### Rollback
```$xslt
$ DATABASE_URL=postgres://owner:owner@localhost:5432/oaks npm run migrate down
```

## Env vars

Required env vars before launch the service (if no default value present)

NAME:type(default)

- SERVER_PORT: number(8082)
- LOG_LEVEL: {debug, info, warn, error}(warn)
- SENTRY_DSN: string(''')
- SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT: string(''')
- SENTRY_RELEASE: string(''')
- DB_HOST: string
- DB_PORT: string
- DB_NAME: string
- DB_USERNAME: string
- DB_PASSWORD: string
- DB_LOG: boolean(false)

## Rest endpoints
- /api-docs will show all the endpoints

## Graph endpoint
- /graph/api (graphiql enabled)


## Current improvements
- Allow to delete tasks
- Allow to delete phases if it doesn't have related tasks
- Allow to update phase if all tasks related are done (the status done could be false if task not done is deleted)
- Allow to update phase and task name
 
## Future improvements

- include comment field to detail each task
- Allow order phases
    - linked list through parent id (performance problem through subselect)
    - orderNum (problem when you want to change from 4 to 2 because need to change
      more rows)
    - probably  is better to use no relational db storing everything in the same
      document
- Allow mark tasks as undone (need to mark also phase as undone if it is done)
